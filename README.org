#+AUTHOR: Rolfe Power

* Overview
These are my solutions to the [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent of Code]] for 2020 in Julia
* Repository Information
This code base is using the Julia Language and [[https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/][DrWatson]] to make a reproducible scientific project named =Advent of Code 2020=.

It is authored by Rolfe Power.

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   #+begin_src 
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   #+end_src  
  

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box.
